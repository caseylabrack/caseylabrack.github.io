           <p>Apologies for the very wide chart. Some of these laws have long titles. You can scroll (drag, on mobile) horizontally.</p>
           <p>A few laws were relabelled for clarity: "Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act" is technically "Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act; Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010"; "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2017" is technically "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018; "Inflation Reduction Act, 2022" is technically "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of S. Con. Res. 14."</p>
